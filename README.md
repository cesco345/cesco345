## Latest Repositories

### [mAb-Stability-Predictor](https://github.com/cesco345/mAb-Stability-Predictor) Public
This repository contains a computational pipeline to predict the stability of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) using PyTorch and PyRosetta. Uses PDB information, calculates features relevant to stability prediction.

**Languages**: Python  
**Last Updated**: 5 minutes ago

### [mAbsAntibodyDiscovery](https://github.com/cesco345/mAbsAntibodyDiscovery) Public
mAb-QualityPredictor: A PyTorch-based Machine Learning Model for Predicting Monoclonal Antibody Quality.

**Languages**: Python  
**Last Updated**: 18 hours ago

### [pyrosetta_intro](https://github.com/cesco345/pyrosetta_intro) Public
Welcome to my PyRosetta repository! PyRosetta is an interactive Python-based interface to the powerful Rosetta molecular modeling suite, allowing users to leverage Rosetta‚Äôs capabilities for protein structure prediction and design.

**Languages**: Jupyter Notebook  
**Last Updated**: 3 days ago

### [molecular_biology_meanderings](https://github.com/cesco345/molecular_biology_meanderings) Public
This is a Jupyter notebook I have put together some of these equations together with some visualizations and code snippets in Python. These visualizations provide different ways to interpret the data.

**Languages**: Jupyter Notebook  
**Last Updated**: last week

### [e_coli-protein-analysis](https://github.com/cesco345/e_coli-protein-analysis) Public
This code demonstrates how to use PyTorch to process the E. coli dataset and train a simple neural network for classification. If you want to use this data with AlphaFold 3 or a similar protein structure prediction tool, this repository can serve as a starting point.

**Languages**: Jupyter Notebook  
**Last Updated**: last week

### [ProteinQualityAnalysis](https://github.com/cesco345/ProteinQualityAnalysis) Public
Protein quality analysis plays a crucial role in ensuring efficacy and safety in the production of monoclonal antibodies, hormones, and enzymes. Protein quality analysis is essential to ensure that the final product meets all regulatory and safety standards.

**Languages**: Python  
**Last Updated**: last week

### [protein-data-collector](https://github.com/cesco345/protein-data-collector) Public
This setup fetches protein data from UniProt and PDB and logs the combined data to the console and saves it in a text file for further AI training and validation. Adjust the query and data handling as needed to suit your project requirements.

**Languages**:
